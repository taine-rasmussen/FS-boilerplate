        I began training in the performing arts at the very young age of three. Always a busy child, demanding the full attention of my family and friends, my parents enrolled me in a Saturday performing arts school. This is where I discovered my passion for singing, dancing and acting.

        At the age of 17 I was awarded a full scholarship to attend one of the most prestigious Musical Theatre and Dance colleges in London - Arts Educational. After completing my three year course, I went on to work professionally as a performer in London’s West End playing Nala in The Lion King.  I also toured the UK and Europe in shows such as Grease, Glee, and Cinderella. I was featured in several prime time TV commercials and appeared on a TV show called ‘Anonymous.’

        It was in between performing jobs that I began teaching and my passion for the performing arts grew to another level. Seeing first-hand how the performing arts helped me grow and develop, not only as a performer, but as a confident person, I wanted to pass this on to the young people of today.

        For seven years I taught all areas of the performing arts in various primary and secondary schools across London, and managed a Saturday performing arts school.

        Having moved to Wellington in 2015 with my Kiwi husband and two daughters, I am thrilled and excited to be bringing all my skills, knowledge, experience and passion to this side of the world, and look forward to enriching students’ lives with the performing arts.
