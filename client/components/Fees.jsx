    <h1>TWO WEEK TRIAL</h1>

        <img src="./Images/Tegan.png" alt="Tegan"/>

        <p>
        We offer all students a two-week trial to give them a real taster for what Spotlight is all about. This will give the students the opportunity to find out if Spotlight is for them, and you, peace of mind that you are committing to something your child really enjoys. The cost of the two-week trial will be deducted from your full termâ€™s fees if you wish to continue with the whole term.

        A 20% deposit is required to secure your child's place and provides you with a two-week trial.

        Sibling discount
        Should more than one child from a family attend, all subsequent children will receive a 10% discount.
